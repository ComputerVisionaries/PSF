    Run puzzle solver
    Input :
        Puzzle : input puzzle image
        Size : pixel width/height of the pieces
        Algorithm : algorithm used to solve puzzle (GA, SA, RHC)
        Iters : number of iterations to run

# flatten puzzle : convert 2d image into 1d array of pieces
# prime algorithm : feed in parameters into the specific alg (puzzle array, ?)
# for round in iters:
#   run trial of algorithm
# get best candidate
# assemble best candidate array into an image
# display solution image
